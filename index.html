                I moved on from the JS Libp2p Tutorial but I know that Shresth has gotten some continued support on it so interested to see where it goes.
                <br/>
                I've enjoyed working on IPFS/Libp2p/Orbit-DB stuff as part of Apollo with the BFLO crew and helped them make some progress there.

                I've started working on a reboot my Arweave mobile wallet project with a ground-up rewrite as a progressive web app, hopefully with the aim of leveraging the community's existing tooling which is all focused on Javascript.  The older app was written in Dart and required me to write the base layer integration with the blockchain on the backend and made development more challenging.

                The Ryder project is going well. We have since received funding from the Stacks Foundation. They operate in a "rolling" fashion so we break the project down into smaller milestones and are approved separately. We are about to incorporate (probably in Singapore) and hired a team to do our rebranding. On a personal level, Blockstack PBC decided to hire me as a consultant, possibly also due to the success of Ryder so far.

                  Launching paid product content in 2021. Starting live podcasts via Airmeet (first in December), in addition to the free podcasts that are released weekly. $RONES will be distributed next month. Negotiated a contract with a Chinese manufacturer to start selling Rare Birds merch in China. I sleep 8 hours every night and am thrilled with life, generally. Thanks for asking. 
                  <br/>
                  The photo below is an image  captured at a pitch event. I have been pitching RB at various pitch events to a Chinese audience. My Chinglish is well received and the feedback and advice from the Chinese has been massively thought provoking. Always different to the West, which is both informative and at times very refreshing. Perspective is a good thing!

                  Uni is growing up! We've joined forces with Mark Beylin (bounties network/consensus) and Sam Hatem (Outpost protocol) to create a much grander reality in Myco. We will be releasing more details to the public shortly but feel free to check out out <a href="https://twitter.com/mycodotspace/status/1324819189463502850">mission</a>, it should resonate well with the Kernel community.
                  <br/>
                  We are going to be raising funds very soon, so if there's anyone interested in chatting about that please reach out.

                  Hello my dear family. I have been well, met a lot of fantastic people, such as Elijah Tai, Luis Freitas, Nick Vale, and so on. I have took part in a number of hackathons and scored top prizes half of the time. Right now my main focus lies on Rent NFT, we will launch it to the mainnet fairly soon: <a href="https://twitter.com/renftlabs">twitter/renftlabs</a>. New hobbies are studying Rust when I have spare time, as well as reminding myself about just how much passion I have for mathematics, and that I would want to dedicate a lot of time to it soon. My Solidity coding is much better since my time at Kernel.

                  P.S. I remember about the pledge I have made about NAZ token, but so far only Austin bought a small amount. Right now, I am using it completely differently to our social crypto influencers. I have loaded it up with all this collateral, and giving it away to people who help me in whatever way, or just for free :)

                Fundraising is about to finish up! Coming out of demo day I had introductions and additional calls with 3 investors, one of which I decided to keep on. 
                Thanks partially to the legitimacy KERNEL added to my project, two other investors were immediately interested and on board, and thanks to those initial investors I was able to get introductions to most of the VC's in the space. We ended up extremely oversubscribed which led to us raising the valuation and the ability to be selective with the investors we took on. 
                <br/>
                Will have additional updates upcoming when its closer to the fundraising announcement!

                  We entertained VC offers for a valuation between $5 - 10 million but we decided to do take smaller bootstrap funding in order to do a fair-launch.

One with a researcher in Protocols Lab and another one with RadicalxChange. I had the chance to chat about blockchain and open science with the hacktivist founder of Sci-Hub. The project is on hold until next year due to our personal agendas. We missed the round 7 of Gitcoin and we are waiting for the next one. Still in touch with a couple of fellows from the Kernel but no gatherings in sight. Recently joined the Circle community and still talking about kernel with friends!

                Gas optimisation help would be great. I have managed to achieve 200k gas to lend an NFT, I think there is still room. The main "hitter" is the nft transfer, which costs 120k, can you imagine that... We will be looking into fundraising as soon as we get traction in the mainnet, probably in a couple of weeks. We need a talented front-end dev and designer in one face, if you have suggestions. Thank you

                All of those! Specially help with connecting with other people interested in helping on the research and potentially fund the project. So far I have been paying most of the expenses for conference/publication fee/user design interviews, so a small grant wouldn't hurt
